# Hana Calculator for the Command-Line.

## About

* * *

Hana Calculate is a modern calculator that can be used
in either basic or complex math equations. Gain the
ability to compute the answers to your math questions
from the command-line.

## Tooling information

* * *

Targeted audience we are building for is MacOSX and Linux users. This project uses
[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) `0.56.0` and newer.

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling:

```console
meson setup builddir
```

The next step should be to compile the target of a configured
Meson project:

```console
meson compile -C builddir
```

Then we install the application like so:

```console
meson install -C builddir
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
hana-calc
```
